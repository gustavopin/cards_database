### Introduction

This is a program that will demonstrate the interaction between Python and SQL.

I'm developing it to organize my collection of One Piece Trading Cards and hopefully add features to it with time.

### What it does now?

For the time being, the program is a CRUD with an interface for adding card and exporting the SQL database to a .xlsx file for easy reading and manipulating if necessary.

### What do I want for the future?

 - Improvements to the UI (delete card, add quantity of cards);
 - Dropdown menus for card types and functions;
 - Future illustrations for the cards from the Bandai data;
 - Deck Builder (advanced and probably for it's final phase).
