### Introduction

This is a program that will demonstrate the interaction between python and SQL.

I'm developing it to organize my collection of One Piece Trading Cards and hopefully implement it with the time.

### What it does now?

For the time being, the program is a simple CRUD, every aspect of it is commented with # and if need will be ready to use.

### What do I want for the future?

 - An interactive UI
 - Easy way yo add cards, edit, and delete them
 - Flag to help search
 - A webscrapper for the Bamdai data for the cards (illustrations, collections, etc)
 - Deck Builder (advanced and probably for it's final phase)
